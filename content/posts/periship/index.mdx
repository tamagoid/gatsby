# A modern take on an old problem

Shipping food and perishables have been challenging for years, and the growth of e-commerce has only increased demand across supply chains. In 2001 PeriShip set a new bar for the industry of perishables shipping and began forcing the competition to rethink their solutions.

PeriShip placed technology at the helm and focused on providing the most technically advanced and detailed tracking solutions. Soon customers were able to read much more than a simple ETA; now clients could access temperature data, see potential weather interruptions, and Lorem Ipsum. 

PeriShip's strategic & exclusive partnership with FedEx, we can leverage the best of their existing logistics infrastructure and provide excellent customer service through our suite of applications and support team.

Eventually, PeriShip's years of success allowed the company to diversify the solutions away from shipping food perishables. In 2017, PeriPharma was established. Offering our proficient solutions to clients in the pharmaceutical industry. And, in less than a year PeriPharma was monitoring an average of 100k weekly shipments, for customers like Sanofi, Optum, and McKesson Corporation. Our team was eventually responsible for shipping COVID-19 vaccines at the peak of the 2020 Global pandemic.

## My contributions to the team

I had the opportunity to work as a junior Software Engineer, with my responsibilities centered around web development in a more full-stack approach compared to my former job. I contributed to various existing Django projects, ranging from client-facing to operations-facing web applications.

At PeriShip, I demonstrated my ability to design and develop with a more full-stack approach. I was responsible for working with RESTful API services and developing modern single-page applications with front-end frameworks.

Some of the technology I used during my team with the PeriShip team includes but is not limited to: 

- Django REST Framework
- Vue.js front-end framework
- AJAX for SPA’s
- MongoDB backend
